## The space complexity of say the number program
Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Primarily determined by the auxiliary variable size . For this particular problem , space complexity is O(1) – constant complexity – takes the same amount of space regardless of the input size. In other words this algorithm allocates the same number of pointers irrespective to the list size . 

## The space complexity of ISBN program 
The space complexity is  O(n).For each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated, i.e. the amount of memory needed to run this algorithm grows no faster than linearly at k * n . n here represents the size of input . Or simply put space increases with the number of input elements at a rate that is linear rather than exponential .
