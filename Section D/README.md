# Student Success

As a code reviewer and bootcamp graduate i have observed several factors that affect task completion and graduation rates . 
In the few paragraphs below , i will describe and explain these factors . Most importantly , i will share my insights on how i look out for potential ‘dropout factors’ in a student, and what i would  do to ensure they don’t drop out . 


1)
It is common knowledge that a bootcamp is an intensive education program thus looking out for dropout factors is key . My first point of call in terms of looking out for potential dropout factors is to track student progress . Most bootcamps are divided into levels .
The first levels are usually easy compared to the last levels .
 In my experience , the higher the level , the more intense and challenging the content becomes . Students usually loose momentum when jumping into the next level . This may cause students dropout . As a mentor i will track the progress of a learner at these stages of their learning journey . 
 My actions towards solving this problem is to first of all book a session with the learner . This call is mainly designed to check the progress of the students . 
After finding subtantial reasons why the student might be losing momentum due to change of levels , i will help the students by providing the student with additional resources and content . I will have the student constantly account to me as a mentor , so that we can track 
progress and tackle the root cause of the problem faster .

2)
Secondly , i will look out for the level of investment the student is channelling towards his studies .
It is common knowledge that  programming isn’t mindless work. You must concentrate all day and actively engage in coding to be successful.Thus lack of effort and concetration to the content provided by the bootcamp
might cause the student to perceive the content as difficult and eventually leading him to dropout .To solve this problem , i will encourage the student and provide a clear step by step procedure of how to tackle and learn something new . As someone who is well vexed with the content , i will clearly explain each concept to the students in a more easy way . Basically teach the student the art of learning the provided content .

3)
Thirdly , the reviews of code reviewers can point you to the right directions . Usually , the reviewers have access to the student's code and work more oftenly and their comments are more crucial in unravelling the status of the students . In other words , reviewers and their reviews are in a position to easily see the status quo of the student in terms of progress and task completion .In general , the reviews of others will play as my first point of call in terms of trying to understand the potential dropout factor in a student .

4) 
Another way of looking out for dropout factors is to constantly check on the students to provide support . Constanly checking on the student also entails checking up on him even if there is no problem he is facing .
Research(referenced below) proves that support for students affects the dropout rates . In other words , the more the support and commitment to help from coding mentors the higher the grades . 

5)
Collaboration and communication with other teams . Collaborating with lectures and mentors can easily help me identify a factor causing or that may cause a student to dropout .
In most cases the issues that lead to dropouts are already known in an institute and the people who have this knowledge are the seniors and other teams within the institute . Hence collaboration and clear communications with others is key .

6)
Laslty the issue of burnout , poor performance , self esteem , lack of prepration , lack of support causes droputs in a bootcamp. I submit that these problems are easy to solve so long as the right support is being channellend towards the student . Boot camps design courses and programs to be completed in a concise amount of time, and for this reason, they are jam-packed with classes. Many will find the pace challenging for their liking and may fail .There are many solution that can be discussed but the majority can be classified under support .
Hence the reason why i submit that support from the mentor and bootcamp is one of the most important factor preventing a student from dropping out . 

Support may include providing providing pre bootcamp courses before the student can start the actual course . Providing the student with resources and study materials not covered in the course . Having one one one session with students to track progress . Building a more engaging and good content for students . Providing network opportunities for learners . Spark determination and teaching students to learn how to learn and many more .

In my capacity as a mentor , i will provide support , constanlty track student progress and spark commitment , communicate with relevant parties who have solution towards handling dropouts , provide external resources where possible , have session with student and help them solve problems that hinder completion (like difficulty in understanding a concepts . All this can be classified as support .

These are my submission .Thank you !
